Terraform module to provision an [`ElastiCache`](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) Redis Cluster or Serverless instance.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

_**Disruptive changes introduced at version 0.41.0**. If upgrading from an earlier version, see
[migration notes](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis/blob/master/docs/migration-notes-0.41.0.md) for details._

Note that this uses secure defaults. One of the ways this module can trip users up is with `transit_encryption_enabled`
which is `true` by default. With this enabled, one does not simply `redis-cli` in without setting up an `stunnel`.
Amazon provides [good documentation on how to connect with it enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/in-transit-encryption.html#connect-tls).
If this is not desired behavior, set `transit_encryption_enabled=false`.

This module creates, by default, a new security group for the Elasticache Redis Cluster / Serverless Instance.
When a configuration change (for example, a different security group name) cannot be applied to the security group, Terraform will
replace that security group with a new one with the new configuration. In order to allow Terraform to fully manage the security group, you
should not place any other resources in (or associate any other resources with) the security group this module
creates. Also, in order to keep things from breaking when this module replaces the security group, you should
not reference the created security group anywhere else (such as in rules in other security groups). If you
want to associate the cluster with a more stable security group that you can reference elsewhere, create that security group
outside this module (perhaps with [terraform-aws-security-group](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-security-group))
and pass the security group ID in via `associated_security_group_ids`.

**Note about `zone_id`**: Previously, `zone_id` was a string. This caused problems (see [#82](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-elasticache-redis/issues/82)).
Now `zone_id` should be supplied as a `list(string)`, either empty or with exactly 1 zone ID in order to avoid the problem.

For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete) or [examples/serverless](examples/serverless).

For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
